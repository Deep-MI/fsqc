Development
===========

Current status
--------------

We are happy to announce the release of version 2.0 of the `fsqc` toolbox. With this release comes a change of the project name from `qatools` to `fsqc`, to reflect increased independence from the original FreeSurfer QA tools, and applicability to other neuroimaging analysis packages - such as `FastSurfer <https://github.com/Deep-MI/FastSurfer>`_.

Recent changes include the addition of the hippocampus and hypothalamus modules as well as the addition of surface and skullstrip visualization modules. Technical changes include how the package is installed, imported, and run, see below for details.

A list of changes is available Changelog section.

Main and development branches
-----------------------------

This repository contains multiple branches, reflecting the ongoing development of the toolbox. The two primary branches are the main branch (`stable`) and the development branch (`dev`). New features will first be added to the development branch, and eventually be merged with the main branch. You are currently on the main branch. To go to the development branch, select it from the drop-down menu on the top left.

Roadmap
-------

The goal of the `fsqc` project is to create a modular and extensible software package that provides quantitative metrics and visual information for the quality control of FreeSurfer- or Fastsurfer-processed MR images. The package is currently under development, and new features are continuously added.

New features will initially be available in the development branch of this toolbox and will be included in the `main branch <https://github.com/Deep-MI/fsqc/tree/stable>`_ after a period of testing and evaluation. Unless explicitly announced, all new features will preserve compatibility with earlier versions.

Feedback, suggestions, and contributions are always welcome, preferably via `issues <https://github.com/Deep-MI/fsqc/issues>`_ and `pull requests <https://github.com/Deep-MI/fsqc/pulls>`_.
