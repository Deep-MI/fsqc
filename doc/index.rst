Description
-----------

This package provides quality assurance / quality control scripts for FastSurfer- or FreeSurfer-processed structural MRI data.

It is a revision, extension, and translation to the Python language of the `Freesurfer QA Tools <https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/QATools>`_.
It has been augmented by additional functions from the `MRIQC toolbox <https://github.com/nipreps/mriqc>`_, and with code derived from the `LaPy <https://github.com/Deep-MI/lapy>`_ and `BrainPrint <https://github.com/Deep-MI/brainprint>`_ toolboxes.
