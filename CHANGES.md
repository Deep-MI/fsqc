# Changelog

This is a document summarizing the changes that are associated with (major) updates and releases. Priority is given to changes that are relevant to the user, and those that introduce new features or break compatibility with prior versions.

## Version 2.0

- New names for main and dev branches: the main (default) branch is now called `stable` (was: `freesurfer-module-releases`), and the dev branch is now called `dev` (was: `freesurfer-module-dev`). The old branches will still be kept for a while in a deprecation state, but will not recieve further updates or support. 
- Screenshots are now in radiological orientation (left is right). Before version 2.0, screenshots were in neurological orientation (left is left).
