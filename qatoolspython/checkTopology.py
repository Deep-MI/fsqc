    A function to check the topology of left and right surfaces.

    This scripts extract the information about the number of holes and defects
    in the left and right hemisphere, and also returns topological fixing time.

    Required arguments:
        - Subjects directory
        - Subject

    Returns:
        - lh_holes, rh_holes, lh_defects, rh_defects, topo_time_lh, topo_time_rh

    Requires valid scripts/recon-all.log file. If not found, NaNs will be
    returned.
