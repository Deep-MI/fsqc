# fsqc toolbox

## Description

This package provides quality assurance / quality control scripts for FastSurfer- or
FreeSurfer-processed structural MRI data.

It is a revision, extension, and translation to the Python language of the
[Freesurfer QA Tools](https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/QATools). It has
been augmented by additional functions from the [MRIQC toolbox](https://github.com/poldracklab/mriqc),
and with code derived from the [LaPy](https://github.com/Deep-MI/lapy) and
[BrainPrint](https://github.com/Deep-MI/brainprint) toolboxes.

The core functionality of this toolbox is to compute the following features:

variable       |   description
---------------|----------------------------------------------------------------
subject        |   subject ID
wm_snr_orig    |   signal-to-noise ratio for white matter in orig.mgz
gm_snr_orig    |   signal-to-noise ratio for gray matter in orig.mgz
wm_snr_norm    |   signal-to-noise ratio for white matter in norm.mgz
gm_snr_norm    |   signal-to-noise ratio for gray matter in norm.mgz
cc_size        |   relative size of the corpus callosum
lh_holes       |   number of holes in the left hemisphere
rh_holes       |   number of holes in the right hemisphere
lh_defects     |   number of defects in the left hemisphere
rh_defects     |   number of defects in the right hemisphere
topo_lh        |   topological fixing time for the left hemisphere
topo_rh        |   topological fixing time for the right hemisphere
con_lh_snr     |   wm/gm contrast signal-to-noise ratio in the left hemisphere
con_rh_snr     |   wm/gm contrast signal-to-noise ratio in the right hemisphere
rot_tal_x      |   rotation component of the Talairach transform around the x axis
rot_tal_y      |   rotation component of the Talairach transform around the y axis
rot_tal_z      |   rotation component of the Talairach transform around the z axis

The program will use an existing output directory (or try to create it) and
write a csv table into that location. The csv table will contain the above
metrics plus a subject identifier.

The program can also be run on images that were processed with [FastSurfer](https://github.com/Deep-MI/FastSurfer)
(v1.1 or later) instead of FreeSurfer. In that case, simply add a `--fastsurfer`
switch to your shell command. Note that FastSurfer's full processing stream must
have been run, including surface reconstruction (i.e. brain segmentation alone
is not sufficient).

In addition to the core functionality of the toolbox there are several optional
modules that can be run according to need:

- screenshots module

This module allows for the automated generation of cross-sections of the brain
that are overlaid with the anatomical segmentations (asegs) and the white and
pial surfaces. These images will be saved to the 'screenshots' subdirectory
that will be created within the output directory. These images can be used for
quickly glimpsing through the processing results. Note that no display manager
is required for this module, i.e. it can be run on a remote server, for example.

- surfaces module

This module allows for the automated generation of surface renderings of the
left and right pial and inflated surfaces, overlaid with the aparc annotation.
These images will be saved to the 'surfaces' subdirectory that will be created
within the output directory. These images can be used for quickly glimpsing
through the processing results. Note that no display manager is required for
this module, i.e. it can be run on a remote server, for example.

- skullstrip module

This module allows for the automated generation cross-sections of the brain
that are overlaid with the colored and semi-transparent brainmask. This allows
to check the quality of the skullstripping in FreeSurfer. The resulting images
will be saved to the 'skullstrip' subdirectory that will be created within the
output directory.

- fornix module

This is a module to assess potential issues with the segmentation of the
corpus callosum, which may incorrectly include parts of the fornix. To assess
segmentation quality, a screenshot of the contours of the corpus callosum
segmentation overlaid on the norm.mgz will be saved as 'cc.png' for each
subject within the 'fornix' subdirectory of the output directory.

- modules for the amygdala, hippocampus, and hypothalamus

These modules evaluate potential missegmentations of the amygdala, hippocampus,
and hypothalamus. To assess segmentation quality, screenshots will be created
These modules require prior processing of the MR images with FreeSurfer's
dedicated toolboxes for the segmentation of the amygdala and hippocampus, and
the hypothalamus, respectively.

- shape module

The shape module will run a shapeDNA / brainprint analysis to compute distances
of shape descriptors between lateralized brain structures. This can be used
to identify discrepancies and irregularities between pairs of corresponding
structures. The results will be included in the main csv table, and the output
directory will also contain a 'brainprint' subdirectory.

- outlier module

This is a module to detect extreme values among the subcortical ('aseg')
segmentations as well as the cortical parcellations. If present, hypothalamic
and hippocampal subsegmentations will also be included.

The outlier detection is based on comparisons with the
distributions of the sample as well as normative values taken from the
literature (see References).

For comparisons with the sample distributions, extreme values are defined in
two ways: nonparametrically, i.e. values that are 1.5 times the interquartile
range below or above the 25th or 75th percentile of the sample, respectively,
and parametrically, i.e. values that are more than 2 standard deviations above
or below the sample mean. Note that a minimum of 10 supplied subjects is
required for running these analyses, otherwise `NaNs` will be returned.

For comparisons with the normative values, lower and upper bounds are computed
from the 95% prediction intervals of the regression models given in Potvin et
al., 1996, and values exceeding these bounds will be flagged. As an
alternative, users may specify their own normative values by using the
'--outlier-table' argument. This requires a custom csv table with headers
`label`, `upper`, and `lower`, where `label` indicates a column of anatomical
names. It can be a subset and the order is arbitrary, but naming must exactly
match the nomenclature of the 'aseg.stats' and/or '[lr]h.aparc.stats' file.
If cortical parcellations are included in the outlier table for a comparison
with aparc.stats values, the labels must have a 'lh.' or 'rh.' prefix. file.
`upper` and `lower` are user-specified upper and lower bounds.

The main csv table will be appended with the following summary variables, and
more detailed output about will be saved as csv tables in the 'outliers'
subdirectory of the main output directory.

variable                 |   description
-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------
n_outliers_sample_nonpar | number of structures that are 1.5 times the IQR above/below the 75th/25th percentile
n_outliers_sample_param  | number of structures that are 2 SD above/below the mean
n_outliers_norms         | number of structures exceeding the upper and lower bounds of the normative values

*Examples:*

- Run the QC pipeline for all subjects found in `/my/subjects/directory`:

```bash
run_fsqc --subjects_dir /my/subjects/directory --output_dir /my/output/directory
```

- Run the QC pipeline for two specific subjects that need to be present in `/my/subjects/directory`:

```bash
run_fsqc --subjects_dir /my/subjects/directory --output_dir /my/output/directory --subjects mySubjectID1 mySubjectID2
```

- Run the QC pipeline for all subjects found in `/my/subjects/directory` after full FastSurfer processing:

```bash
run_fsqc --subjects_dir /my/subjects/directory --output_dir /my/output/directory --fastsurfer
```

- Run the QC pipeline plus the screenshots module for all subjects found in `/my/subjects/directory`:

```bash
run_fsqc --subjects_dir /my/subjects/directory --output_dir /my/output/directory --outlier --outlier-table /my/table/with/normative/values.csv
```

- Note that the `--screenshots`, `--fornix`, `--shape`, and `--outlier` (and other) arguments can also be used in conjunction.

### As a Python package

As an alternative to their command-line usage, the fsqc scripts can also be run
within a pure Python environment, i.e. installed and imported as a Python package.

Use `import fsqc` (or sth. equivalent) to import the package within a
Python environment, and use the `run_fsqc` function from the `fsqc` module to
run an analysis.

In its most basic form:

```python
import fsqc
fsqc.run_fsqc(subjects_dir='/my/subjects/dir', output_dir='/my/output/dir')
```

Specify subjects as a list:

```python
import fsqc
fsqc.run_fsqc(subjects_dir='/my/subjects/dir', output_dir='/my/output/dir', subjects=['subject1', 'subject2', 'subject3'])
```

And as a more elaborate example:

```python
import fsqc
fsqc.run_fsqc(subjects_dir='/my/subjects/dir', output_dir='/my/output/dir', subject_file='/my/subjects/file.txt', screenshots_html=True, surfaces_html=True, skullstrip_html=True, fornix_html=True, hypothalamus_html=True, hippocampus_html=True, hippocampus_label="T1.v21", shape=True, outlier=True)
```


Call `help(fsqc.run_fsqc)` for further usage info and additional options.
